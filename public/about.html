<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Resumes
  The cornerstone of Reswyze & Wordsmithing's business, Aubrey's resumes are powerful, achievement-focused documents. Each resume meets all current best practices and begins with a personal branding statement that is carefully tailored to each client.
  
  Job application resumes (what most people think of as a "resume") are, additionally, compatible with the applicant tracking systems that most companies use to perform the initial candidate screen, while networking resumes (also known as personal marketing briefs) are designed to communicate your value in just one page--perfect for networking events and, in an interview, as a supplement to your job application resume.
  
  ​Aubrey is an expert at writing all resume levels from entry-level to C-suite executive, as well as producing resumes in specialized formats such as federal, curriculum vitae, and military. Your resume investment includes a strategic interview, which kicks off the project.
  
  ​Discounts are available for full-time students, new graduates, active duty military, veterans, military/veteran spouses and parents, and those who have been unemployed one year or longer..</p>

<p>LinkedIn is almost as vital, in today's digital job market, as a resume. If you don't have a profile, or if your profile doesn't align with your new resume, you're missing out on vital networking and job opportunities. Let Melissa create new content for your profile from the ground up--when she's done, you'll receive an email with updated content that's ready to paste into your existing profile, along with basic instructions on how to update your profile. If you don't currently have a profile, let Melissa know and she will also send basic instructions on how to create an account with your new content.

  ​In addition to new content for your profile, our LinkedIn service includes a Udemy course, "How to Find a Job on LinkedIn Without Going Crazy," that coaches you in best practices and helps you update your profile online. The course is extraordinarily comprehensive and provides you with everything from a LinkedIn update demonstration to current tips and tricks for getting the most out of your new profile.
  
  Note: Because of recent changes to LinkedIn's terms and conditions, Aubrey can neither create an account for you nor log into your account to update your profile. </p>
